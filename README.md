# SpeakSafe AI

**One-line:**  
A simple web app that uses AI to detect online harassment, threats, or abusive messages toward women and girls and guides them on what to do next.

## 🚀 What is SpeakSafe AI?

SpeakSafe AI is a lightweight, web-based tool designed to empower women and girls by helping them understand if a message they received is abusive or harmful — and what to do about it.  
No bots, no complicated systems: just input → AI detection → guidance → safe evidence storage.

## 💡 The Problem

Many women and girls in online spaces face harassment, but they often don’t know:

- Whether a message is just “normal talk” or is actually harmful  
- What next steps to take (report, block, reach out)  
- How to safely store proof of abuse  

SpeakSafe AI fills that gap by giving instant clarity and actionable advice.

## 🧪 How It Works

1. A user pastes or types a message into a text box.  
2. The AI analyzes the message using a toxicity / harassment detection model.  
3. The app returns a result, indicating:  
   - ✅ *Safe*  
   - ⚠️ *Harmful*  
   - 🚨 *Dangerous*  
4. Based on the result, the app offers clear guidance, such as:  
   - “Block & report”  
   - “Save as evidence”  
   - “Contact local helpline”

## 🛡️ Privacy & Safety Considerations

- The app **does not require personal registration** — users can use it anonymously.  
- Messages labeled as “harmful” or “dangerous” can be saved locally in a **secure way** via the app’s history.  
- Sensitive data should be encrypted if stored (depending on your implementation).  
- Provide clear disclaimers that SpeakSafe AI is **not a substitute for legal help or emergency services** — and encourage users to contact trusted resources or professionals when needed.
